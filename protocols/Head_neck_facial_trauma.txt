 Comments
  Avoid prophylactic hyperventilation. Hyperventilation for head trauma is ONLY
 indicated for 
signs of cerebral herniation (posturing, pupillary abnormalities, sudden neurologic 

deterioration) NOT due to hypotension or hypoxemia. 
 
o Hyperventilation
 for adults is 16
-20 breaths per minute. 
 o Utilize Et CO2 and adjust ventilation rate to 
keep EtCo2 at 30 to 35 mmHg. 
  If the patient deteriorates, recheck for problems with airway, breathing or circulation.
 Base Hospital Contact Criteria
  Pain management 
for patients with evidence of hypotension (smaller doses for elderly and 
very young).
