-6 L/min) for 
awake, oriented, stable patients without evidence of hypoperfusion or 100% high flow 
via nonrebreather mask (10
-15 L/min) if indicated. 
  NOTES
  Some inhalational poisonings, such as carbon monoxide and hydrogen sulfide, may 
result in patients with normal 
oxygen
 saturation
 readings, but cellular hypoxia due to 
displacement of the

  In all of the above cases, maximal 
Oxygen
 therapy should be delivered to the patient 
regardless of pulse oximeter reading if the patient has signs of respiratory compromise.
