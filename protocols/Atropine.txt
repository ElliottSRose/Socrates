ATROPINE SULFATE
   ACTION:  
Anticholinergic
 (Vagolytic)
  Blocks acetylcholine receptors 
resulting in reduction of 
parasympath
athetic tone and 
increased 
conduction through the AV node.
  Increases sinus node automaticity and AV conduction when suppressed by abnormal 
parasympathetic or vagal discharges.
  Antagonizes action of organophosphate agents
.  
INDICATIONS:
  Symptomatic bradycardia
. 
 Organophosphate or carbamate insecticide
 or nerve agent exposure
. 
 
CONTRAINDICATIONS:
  Atrial 
fibrillation or atrial flutter
  
 Glaucoma
  
POTENTIAL SIDE EFFECTS:
  Increase heart rate causing tachycardias
.  Post
-atropine tachycardias can precipitate V
-Fib 
or 
V-
Tach.
  Can worsen patient™s ischemia or extend size of 

infarct.
  Dry mouth.
  Doses lower than 0.5 mg can 
produce slowing of the heart.
  Dilated pupils.
  Decreased salivation.
  Flushed, hot skin.
   
ADULT DOSE/ROUTE
: 
 Symptomatic B
radycardia
:  0.5
mg IVP
 or 
IO. May repeat 
every
5min
 up to 3 mg
 if no 
resolution of bradycardia.
  Organophosphate 
Poisoning
/Nerve agent 
Exposure
:  2 Œ 5
mg 
IVP
 or IO. 
May repeat 
in 5 minutes.
 No max dose. 
  
PEDIATRIC DOSE/ROUTE:
  Symptomatic 
Bradycardia: 
 0.02 mg/kg 
IVP
 or IO (min dose 0.1mg, max dose 0.5mg)
  Organophosphate 
Poisoning
:  0.0
2 
mg/kg 
IVP
 or 
IO (min dose 0.1mg, no max dose
) 
 
NOTES:
  External pacing is the treatment of choice for symptomatic bradycardia if there is suspected 
myocardial ischemia, or 2
nd or 3
rd
 degree AV blocks are present.
  Can be given IM in thigh for suspected organophosphate poisoning
 /
nerve agent exposure.
  Note:
 the primary cause of bradycardia in pediatric patients is hypoxia.
 Atropine is no longer recommended for adult or pediatric asystole.
