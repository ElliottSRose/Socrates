 INDICATION
  Suspected or Obvious extremity fracture.
  Appropriate splinting can reduce or minimize dislocation, motion, hemorrhage, swelling, 
and pain. 
  PROCEDURE 
 1. Remove or cut away clothing. 
 2. Dress and bandage significant wounds using a sterile dressing. 
 3. Check CMS distal to injury before and after splinting. 
 4. Immobilize joints above and below injured bones. 
 5. For joint injuries, leave in place and immobilize the bone above and below the joint 
 6. If extremity is pulseless
 it may be necessary on a mid
-shaft (center 1/3) fracture to 
realign angulated injuries. 
 7. Pad splints well. 
 8. Elevate extremity after splinting, if possible. 
 9. Monitor CMS after splinting. 
  GUIDELINES FOR SPECIFIC INJURIES 
 Realignment of Long Bone Fractures 
  If extremity is pulseless
 attempt t
o realign (open or closed) long bones that are 
angulated in the middle 1/3 then splint. If resistance to movement is encountered or 

pain is too severe, discontinue realignment efforts and immobilize in place. 
  Long-
bone fractures which occur in the proxima
l or distal 1/3, that may or may not 
involve a joint, may be realigned if compromise of distal circulation or nerve function is 
detected and transport is prolonged. 
  Realignment may sometimes be necessary to facilitate packaging for transport. 
  Check and d
ocument CMS before and after splinting and/or realignment. 
  Dislocations/Sprains 
  Splint dislocations or other joint injuries in the position found. 
  Exception: Loss of a distal pulse and neurological function and definitive care is delayed. 
 o In that case
, attempt to straighten into anatomical position until the pulse 
returns, excessive pain is felt, or resistance is encountered. 
 o Support with blanket, pillow, or well
-padded splint. 
 o Elevate the limb. 
 o Pack the injured area in ice or use an ice pack.
  
TRAC
TION SPLINTING
  A lower extremity traction splint stabilizes fractures of the femur. This reduces motion, 

hemorrhage, swelling, and pain. Traction splints are indicated in midshaft femoral 

fractures without involvement of the hip joint, knee, or lower leg.

 1. Two EMTs are needed to apply a traction splint. 
 2. Remove or cut away clothing. 
 3. Dress and bandage significant wounds using a sterile dressing. 
 4. Manually immobilize the injured extremity prior to dressing/bandaging.
  
5. Do not apply manual traction. Check distal CMS before and after manipulation. 
 6. Determine SICK/NOTSICK 
 7. Control Bleeding 
 8. Size splint to uninjured leg 
 9. Have one EMT stabilize the leg while the other applies the traction device. 
 10. Apply splint 
  Groin strap 
  Ankle hitch 
  Knee strap 
  Extend 
  Thigh and calf straps 
 11. Reassess CMS and vital signs
