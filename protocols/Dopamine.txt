11 DOPAMINE 
(Intropin
) 
 ACTION:  Inotropic
, Chronotropic
  Catecholamine
 (sympathomimetic)
  Dose depend stimulation of alpha, beta and dopaminergic receptors.  
  At 
low doses
 (2 to 5 mcg/kg/min) stimulates dopaminergic receptors (renal and mesenteric 
artery dilation).
  At 
medium doses
 (5 to 
10 mcg/kg/min) stimulates beta receptors (increased heart 
rate and 
contractility resulting in increased cardiac output).
  At 
high doses
 (greater than 10 mcg/kg/min) stimulates alpha
-adrenergic receptors (peripheral 
vasoconstriction, increased blood pressure).
 INDICATIONS:
 Hypotension due to:
  Cardiogenic shock
.  Dis
tributive shock
:  Neurogenic and anaphylactic shock. 
  Symptomatic bradycardias
 unresponsi
ve to other treatments such as atropine and pacing.
  
CONTRAINDICATIONS:
  Tachydysrhythmias.
  Use only 1/10 the normal dose in patients on Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIâ„¢s) such 

as:  Eutonyl, Parnate, Nardil as they potentiate the effects of Dopamine.
 POTENTIAL SIDE EFFECTS:
  Tachydysrhythmias including V
-Tach 
and V
-Fib.
  Hypertension.
  Nausea and vomiting.
  Chest pain, ischemia and acute MI 
exacerbation.
  Extravasation
 causes tissue necrosis.
  
ADULT DOSE/ROUTE
: 
 Cardiogenic or distributive shock
: 5-
20 mcg/kg/min IV/IO infusion. Titrate to SBP >90 
mmHg.
  
PEDIATRIC DOSE/ROUTE:
  Cardiogenic or distributive shock
: 5-
20 mcg/kg/min IV/IO 
infusion
. 
Initiate only per 
instructions from Base Hospital MD
. 
NOTES:
  Do not infuse 
in same line 
with
