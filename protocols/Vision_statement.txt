CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO
 PREHOSPITAL CARE VISION AND ETHICS STATEMENT
 2015 Our EMS community consists of a team of health care professionals including EMT
-1™s, Paramedics, 
Nurses, Physicians, Researchers, Dispatchers and system Educators and Admini
strators. This statement 
defines our goals and ethical responsibilities and is beneficial in guiding our practice.
 We believe that–
  We exist to provide the best possible emergency care to the residents and visitors of the City 
and County of San Francisco a
t all times and in all places.
  Competent medical care must be provided with compassion and regard for human dignity to all 
persons, regardless of ethnicity, race, creed, gender, economic status, sexual orientation, 
gender identity, age or response to our c
are.
  Patients who are competent have the right to determine what shall be done with their body and 

to receive or refuse medical service and to know the consequences of their decision.
  We are accountable for providing medical care to the best of our ability
 and for accurately 
documenting our care.
  Patients and colleagues must be dealt with in an honest and truthful manner in all matters 
pertaining to our prehospital care.
  The highest standard of professional conduct must be maintained with providing medical 
care, 
including respect, confidentiality and maintenance of personal competence and teaching other 
members of the prehospital community.
  We are responsible for upholding the standards of the profession and for participating in 
activities that contribute to
 its growth and improve our community.
  We must obey and respect the law and not participate in any professionally unethical activities. 

We refuse to let personal considerations such as economic gain or convenience influence our 
provision of patient care, and we refrain from activities which may impair our professional 

judgment and our ability to act competently.
  Our EMS system, organization, supervisors, peers and subordinates deserve our utmost loyalty.
  Where conflicts of interest arise, our professional j
udgments should always be guided by our 
ultimate obligation which is to our patients and the public that we serve.
  We are committed to accomplishing our job; and that commitment stems from the desire to be 

the best we can possibly be and the affirmation of
 all the preceding elements of this code.
