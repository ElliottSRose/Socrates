  Comments
  Treat 
cardiac 
dysrhythmias according to 
protocol.
  Severely hypothermic patients may need prolonged palpation/observation to detect pulse 
and respirations.
  Bradycardia is normal; very slow rates may be sufficient for metabolic demands.
  Defibrillation may not be effective until patient is re
-warmed
. 
 Do NOT determine death for acutely hypothermic patient unless re
-warmed or patient is 
determined dead by other criteria.
  Avoid heat packs with temperature > 110 degrees Fahrenheit that may burn patientâ„¢s skin.
  Excessive movement of the patient may precip
itate ventricular fibrillation. Use caution 
while performing advanced 
airway management
 or when moving patient.
  Hypothermic 
cardiac arrest
 patients with return of spontaneous circulation should not be 
actively cooled. Keep patient covered and transport to STAR center.
  Pale, cool, insensate extremities may be due to frostbite.
  Frostbite: DO NOT rub or apply hot packs;
 manage affected extremities gently; keep 
covered and avoid exposures that might cause thawing and re
-freezing.
