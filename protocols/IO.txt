 INDICATION
  Critically ill or injured patients
 o Unable to obtain pulse;
 o Unresponsive;
 o Apneic;
 o Hypotension with 
shock
; 
o Acute deteriorating level of consciousness.
  If vascular access canno
t be established via peripheral IV in 2 attempts or less than 90 
seconds, then proceed with either IO or PVAD access. 
  Less invasive route of medication administration (PO, IN, IM) is preferred for stable 
patients prior to the attempting an IO insertion.
  PROCEDURE
 1. Assemble needed equipment. 
 2. Non
-traumatized proximal tibia is the preferred insertion site.  Locate the landmarks 2
-3 cm below the tibial tuberosity on the anteromedial flat bony surface of the proximal tibia 

and prepare the site.
 3. If there is sig
nificant trauma or fractures bilaterally in the lower extremities then the 
humeral head may be used for intraosseous insertion. 
 a. Place the patientâ„¢s hand over their umbilicus on the side chosen for insertion in 
order to perform a medial rotation of the 
hum
orous
 and elbow. 
 b. Place the IO about 1 cm above the surgical neck of the 
humorous
.  c. Secure extremity in swath bandage.
 4. Insert the IO needle holding the leg (or arm) steady:
 a. Grasp the needle with the obturator still in place and insert it through the skin a
t the selected site at a 90
-degree angle to the skin surface.
 5. When the needle is felt to 'pop' into the bone marrow space:
 a. Remove the obturator.
 b. Attach a syringe with 0.5 mg/kg of 
2% Li
docaine
 solution
 (max dose 50 mg) and 
flush the IO needle in patients who are conscious. 
 c. Attach a <10 ml syringe containing IV solution, to flush the IO needle 30 to 60 
seconds following 
lidocaine
 administration. 
 OR d. Remove the obturator; attach
 a primed IV solution se
t with or without a stop 
cock.
 e. Draw 5 ml of fluid from the IV bag then pinch or close the stopcock and flush IO 

needle. 
 6. If unable to flush, continue procedure and watch
 carefully for extravasation and swelling 
while infusing fluids and/or medications.
 7. Secure the needle by taping and splint the leg as indicated to maintain stability.
 8. If infiltration occurs or needle removed, stop the infusion, remove the needle, and apply
 a pressure bandage to the IO site. If another IO will be attempted, use a different bone.

 NOTES
  Active pushing of fluids may be more successful than gravity infusion. Use the same size 
syringe for fluid boluses.
  An insertion device pre
-approved by the EM
S Agency Medical Director may be utilized 
according to manufacturer instructions substituting for steps 2 through 4 above.
