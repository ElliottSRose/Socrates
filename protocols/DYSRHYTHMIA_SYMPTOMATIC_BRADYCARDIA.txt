 (TCP) as needed for continued unstable bradycardia
. 
 If agitated during TCP and SBP > 90, may administer 
Midaz
olam

 Titrate to maintain SBP > 90
. 
 If dialysis patient with suspecte
d hyperkalemia [T wave is peaked; QRS is prolonged (>0.12 
seconds) or hypotension develops] AND bradycardia is unresponsive to 
Atropine
 and 
Transcutaneous pacing
, administer 
Calcium Chlo

.  If suspected hyperkalemia persists (peaked T wave; prolong QRS), adm
inister 
Albuterol
