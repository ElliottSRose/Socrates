INDICATION
 Patients who present following decelerating or blunt force injury suspicious for head or neck 
trauma with any of the following should have Spinal Motion Restriction:
  Midline back or neck pain.
  Numbness, weakness or paresthesias of the extremitie
s.  Blunt and or penetrating injury to the head or neck
. Penetrating trauma does not 
require SMR unless spinal injury is suspected.
  Altered mental status
 of unknown etiology with traumatic injury suspected.
  
Spinal Motion Restriction is NOT indicated if the patient meets ALL the following criteria
: 
 Age <65.
  No decrease or change in baseline mental or neurological status.
  No suspected or witnessed axial load injury to head.
  No numbness, we
akness or paresthesias of the extremities.
  No significant distracting injuries.
  Reliable translation for any language barrier.
  No vertebral column injury noted on palpation.
  Patient able to perform motor/sensory exam without deficits:
 o Wrist or finger flexi
on (both hands), plantarflexion (both feet), dorsiflexion (both 

feet). 
 o Check gross sensation in all extremities.
 o Check for parasthesias.
  
EMTs and Paramedics shall apply or direct application of SMR whenever extent of injury is in 
question or patient hist
ory is unreliable.
  PROCEDURE
 1. Limit flexion, extension, rotation and distraction of spine.
 2. Provide manual stabilization restricting gross motion. 
 3. Reduce gross movement of patient.
 4. Prevent duplicating the damaging mechanism to spine.
 5. Regularly assess senso
ry and motor function.
 6. Obtain assistance (minimum 2
-person procedure) to apply rigid cervical collar.  Alert and 
co-operative patients may be allowed to self
-limit motion, if appropriate, without 
cervical collar.
  
NOTES
  Methods used to achieve Spinal Motion Restriction that are allowable include (less 
restrictive to more restrictive)
: 
o Lateral, semi
-fowler™s or fowler™s position with cervical collar onl
y. o Soft collars
 o Pillows
 o Mattress

o Children™s car seats
 o KED, backboards with adequate paddin
g 
o Hea
d immobilizers and straps
  
 In the event that a patient meets inclusion criteria for SMR, but cannot or will not 
tolerate allowable methods, consider manual stabilization using additional rescuers, 
tools or techniques to achieve limited spinal motion durin
g extricatio
n and transport.
  Long spine boards are indicated only in patients who exhibit neurological deficits, 
decreasing level of consciousness or inability to be screened for discontinuation of 
spinal motion restriction.
  Once SMR has been applied to a
 patient, it
 may NOT be discontinued in the field.
