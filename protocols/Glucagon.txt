17 GLUCAGON
  ACTION:  Hormone/
Antihypoglycemic
  Glucagon is a hormone secreted by the pancreas that causes a breakdown of stored glycogen 

into glucose and 
stops glucose 
conversion
 into glycogen
 resulting in increased circulating 
blood glucose.
  Glucagon is only effective if there are sufficient stores of
 glycogen in the liver.
  Used 
in treatment of

; likely mechanism of action is the increase of 
cAMP in the 
myocardium

POTENTIAL SIDE 
EFFECTS:
