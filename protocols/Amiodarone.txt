AMIODARONE
  ACTION:  
Antiarrhythmic
  Antiarrhythmic that slows conduction and lengthens the cardiac action potential resulting in 

suppression of ventricular and supraventricular tachycardias.
  
INDICATIONS:
  Hemodynamically unstable ventricular tachycardia
  Ventricular fibrillation
 and 
ventricular tachycardia without a pulse
  
CONTRAINDICATIONS:
  Sinus node dysfunction or sinus bradycardia
  2nd or 3rd degree block
  Known hypersensitivity from past exposure
  
POTENTIAL SIDE EFFECTS:
  May prolong QT interval
  May 
cause hypotension
  
ADULT DOSE/ROUTE
: 
 VF or pulseless VT
: 300 mg
 slow 
IVP 
or IO bolus
. Repeat 150 mg 
slow 
IVP 
or IO bolus if 
rhythm persists
. 
 Stable / 
Unstable VT with pulse
: 
Inject 150 mg of Amiodarone into 100
ml of D5W
. Run 
with 
target goal of infusing 100 ml over 10 minutes.
  
PEDIATRIC 
DOSE/ROUTE:
  VF or pulseless VT only
: 5 mg/kg 
IVP
 or IO bolus
. Maximum dose 300 mg
. 
 
NOTES:
  Flush tubing with NS between dosages
.  Signs of
 Amiodarone
 toxicity include hypotension, 3
rd
 degree AV block and prolonged QT 
interval.
  Do not use 
Amiodarone
 in the presence of underlying atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, 
bradycardia with ventricular escape beats, or other conduction defect (2nd or 3rd degree 

AV block).
  Do not administer if pa
tient
 with pulse
 is hypotensive
. 
Do synchronized cardioversion. 
  Stop administration if patient becomes hypotensive during treatment.
  Do not administer with bicarbonate in the same IV line (will precipitate).
  When creating infusion, careful mixing is 
needed to avoid foaming of the medication.
  Reconstitute Amiodarone per manufacturerâ„¢s directions.
