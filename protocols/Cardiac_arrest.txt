 FIELD
 TREATMENT
 CONSIDERATIONS
 FOR
 PATIENTS
  
WITH
 A 
LEFT
 VENTRICULAR
 ASSIST
 DEVICE
 (LVAD)
  
1. Attempt
 to locate
 a 
POLST
 form.
 Many
 patients
 have
 made
 end
-of-life
 care
 decisions.
  2. Provide
 pre
-hos
pital
 care
 to the
 patient
 in a 
manner
 consis
tent
 with
 ALS 
and
 BLS
 treatment
 protocols
 for
 the patient™s
 condition
 with
 the
 following
 exceptions:
   
Ł Do NOT
 perform
 chest
 compressions
 since
 it will
 dislodge
 the
 LVAD
 and
 cause
 internal
 bleeding.
 Ł Arrhythmias
: Do 
not
 disconnect
 power
 source,
 defibrillate
 per
 ACLS
 protocol.
 Ł DO follow
 the
 directions
 of the patient™s
 caregiver
 when
 moving
 and
 transporting
 the patient.
   
 3. The
 HeartMate
 (HM)
 II LVAD
 replaces
 the
 pumping
 action
 of the
 left
 ventricle
 via
 a 
continuous
 blood flow
 mechanism,
 where
 there
 is no fillin
g 
or emptying
 phase.
  
Ł As a 
result,
 patients
 commonly
 have
 NO
 PALPABLE 
PULSE,
 NO
 OBTAINABLE
 PULSE
 OXIMETRY
 OR BLOOD
 PRESSURE,
 and
 only
 a 
ﬁmean
ﬂ 
arterial
 pressure
 detectable
 using
 a 
Doppl
er.

 Ł An LVAD
 patient™s
 ECG
 heart
 rate
 will
 differ
 from
 the pulse
 rate
 since
 the LVAD
 is not
 synchronized
 with
 the
 native
 heart
 rate.
    4. Assess
 the
 patient™s
 airway
 and
 intervene
 per
 protocol.
 If you
 are unable
 to obtain
 pulse
 oximetry
 readings,
 you
 should
 assume
 the patient
 is hypoxic
 and
 place
 the
 patient
 on supplemental
 oxy
gen
.  
 5. If the
 patient
 has
 an altered
 level
 of consciousness,
 immediately
 check
 for
 end
-tidal
 CO2
 using
 capnography.
  
 6. Auscultate
 heart
 sounds
 to determine
 if the
 device
 is functioning.
 You
 should
 expect
 to hear
 a 
continuous
 ﬁwhirlingﬂ
 sound
 for
 most
 devic
es.
  
 7. Assess
 the
 device
 for
 any
 alarms / 
malfunctions.
 Check
 with
 patient
 or caregivers
 for
 device
 reference
 materials
 or contact
 the
 VAD
 Center.
  8. Start
 at least
 1 
large
 bore
 IV,
 and
 give
 a 
1L Normal
 Saline
 fluid
 bolus
 if you
 obtain
 a 
low
 blood
 pressure
 (systolic
 < 
100)
 or are
 unable
 to obtain
 a 
blood
 pressure
 or the
 patient
 has
 an altered
 level
 on consciousness.
  
 9. Call the LVAD
 Center
 (open
 24/7)
 per
 patient
 or patient™s
 caretaker™s
 contact
 to get
 advice
 on caring
 for
 the patient.
  You are
 authorized
 to take
 orders
 from
 professionals
 at the
 LVAD
 Center,
 as long
 as they
 are within
 your
 scope
 of practice.
  Contact
 the
 Base
 Hospital
 with
 questions
 or if directed
 by patient™s
 caregiver
 or LVAD 
Center
 personnel
 to do something
 outside
 of 
your
 protocol.
    10. Always
 transport
 the
 patient
 to the
 LVAD
 Center
 that
 implanted
 the device
 (UCSF
 or CPMC
-Pac).
  You are authorized
 to BYPASS
 the
 closest
 San
 Francisco
 LVAD 
Center
 to get
 the patient
 to the
 LVAD
 Center
 that
 implanted
 their
 device
 no matte
r 
the
 patient™s
 condition.
  If the LVAD 
Center
 that
 implanted
 the
 device
 is not
 in San
 Francisco,
 take
 the patient
 to the
 closest
 San
 Francisco
 based
 LVAD
 Center.
  
Ł Bring
 ALL
 of the
 patient™s
 equipment.
 Bring
 the patient™s
 caregiver
 to act
 as the
 informatio
n 
resource
 on the device.
 You are authorized
 to use
 the caregiver
 as an information
 resource
 on the
 device.
  
 11. Upon
 arrival
 to Emergency
 Department,
 immediately
 plug
 in the device
 into
 an electrical
 socket.
  12. Call the Base
 Hospital
 for
 in-field
 termination
 of 
care
 in the
 event
 there
 are
 no signs
 of life
 and
 end
-tidal
 capnography
 is not
 consistent
 with
 life
 (< 10).
