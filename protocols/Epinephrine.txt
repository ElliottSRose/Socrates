14 EPINEPHRINE (Adrenaline)
 ACTION:  Sympathomimetic
  Catecholamine (sympathomimetic) with alpha and beta adrenergic action.
  Results in increased heart rate, systemic vascular resistance, and blood 
pressure.  It also 
causes bronchodilation due to its effects of beta
-2 adrenergic receptors.
  
INDICATIONS:
  All cardiac arrest patients, including V
-Fib, pulseless V
-Tach, asystole and PEA.
  Anaphylaxis.
  Severe bronchospasm.
  Refractory symptomatic bradycardi
a.  
CONTRAINDICATIONS:
  None in cardiac arrest.
  Tachydysrhythmias.
  Use with extreme caution for severe asthma or allergic reactions in patients >age 40 or in 

patients with coronary artery disease since myocardial ischemia may be precipitated.
  Intravenous
 E
pinephrine should
 only
 be used in extreme emergencies or cardiac arrest. Use 
intramuscular initially for patients with anaphylaxis.
  POTENTIAL SIDE EFFECTS:
  Increased myocardial O
2 demand leading to chest 
pain and myocardial ischemia.
  Tachydys
rhythmias including V
-Tach and V
-Fib.
  Headache and dizziness.
  Nausea and vomiting.
   ADULT DOSE/ROUTE:
  For indications other than cardiac arrest including a
naphylaxis:
 (1:1,000
) 0.3mg IM. May 
repeat x1.
 If hypotension not responding to IM 
Epinephrine x2 or IV fluid boluses, give 
Epinephrine (1:10,000) IV 0.1mg slow IV/IO over 5 minutes. 
Max
 IV dose 0.3mg.
  
 Cardiac Arrest:
 (1:10,000) 1mg IVP/IO at the time intervals specified in Protocol 2.04 Cardiac 
Arres
t - 
VF/pulseless VT and asystole/PEA.
  PEDIATRIC DOSE/ROUTE:
  For indications other than cardiac arrest including a
naphylaxis:
 (1:1,000) 0.01 mg/kg IM in 
anterolateral thigh
. May repeat x1 in 5 minutes.
   Cardiac Arrest:
 0.01 mg/kg IVP/IO (1:10,000) 
at the t

12 EPINEPHRINE 1MG/1000ML (1MCG/ML) INFUSION
 FOR USE ONLY WHEN DOPAMINE ON SHORTAGE
  ACTION:  Inotropic, Chronotropic
  Catecholamine (sympathomimetic
).  Dose dependent stimulation of alpha, beta and dopaminergic receptors.  
  INDICATIONS 
Hypotension due to:
  Cardiogenic shock
.  Distributive shock
:  Neurogenic and anaphylactic shock. 
  Symptomatic bradycardias
 unresponsive to other treatments such as atropine and pacing.
  CONTRAINDICATIONS:
  None in life threatening situation
  
POTENTIAL SIDE EFFECTS:
  Tachydysrhythmias including V
-Tach 
and V
-Fib
  Hypertension
  Nausea and vomiting
  Chest pain, ischemia and acute MI 
exacerbation
 Extravasation causes tissue necrosis
  ADULT DOSE/ROUTE:
  Cardiogenic or distributive shock
: Inject 1mg (1:1000 OR 1:10,000) epinephrine into 1000ml 
of 0.9% sodium chloride. DO NOT USE PRESSURE BAG,
 run it at ~10
-20ml/min using
 the drip 
chamber
. If SBP>90mm Hg, use roller clamp to slow rate.
  
PEDIATRIC DOSE/ROUTE:
  NOT FOR PEDIATRIC USE. Contact Base Hospital MD.
  NOTES:
  Do not infuse in same line with sodium bicarbonate
  Ensure that the patient is not hypovolemic before infusing
  Label bag clearly to prevent rapid infusion
