ADENOSINE (
Adenocard)
  ACTION: Antiarrhythmic
  Decreases conduction through the atrioventricular (AV) node interrupting re
-entry 
pathways. 
  Interrupts
 and may convert
 paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT).
   INDICATIONS
: 
 Hemodynamically stable PSVT.
  Narrow and w
ide
-complex
, regular, monomorphic 
tachycardia
. 
 
CONTRAINDICATIONS:
  2nd or 3rd degree AV block
  Sick sinus syndrome.
  Polymorphic wide complex 
tachycardia
  Do not use 
Adenosine
 on a patient with a known history of Wolff
-Parkinson
-White (WPW) 
syndrome. 
   
 POTENTIAL SIDE EFFECTS:
  Transient asystole (up to 20 to 30 secs.)
  Dyspnea and bronchospasms
  Chest pressure
  Hypotension
  Facial flushing and 
headaches
  Nausea
  
ADULT DOSE/ROUTE
: 
 First dose
: 6 mg rapid IVP/IO
* followed with 20 ml Normal Saline flush. 
  If first dose 
ineffective, repeat with 
12 mg rapid IVP/IO
.* M
ay repeat 12mg x 1 if 
still 
ineffective.
 *IV preferred route
  
PEDIATRIC 
DOSE/ROUTE
: 
 First dose
: 0.1 mg/kg rapid IVP/IO
*followed by 10ml NS flush (max first dose 6 mg)
. 
 If first dose
 ineffective, repeat with
 0.2 mg/kg rapid IVP/IO
* (max second dose 12 mg)
. May 
repeat 0.2 mg/kg x 1 if 
still 
ineffective.
 *IV preferred route
  
NOTES:
  Clinically evaluate patients
Šadult and pediatric
Što distinguish primary tachyarrhythmias 
such as PSVT
Šfrom patient conditions leading to sinus tachycardias.
  Adenosine is blocked by methylxanthines (caffeine) and potentiated by dipyridamole and 

carbamazepine.
