 INDICATION
  Critically ill or injured patients
 o Unable to obtain pulse;
 o Unresponsive;
 o Apneic;
 o Hypotension with 
shock
; 
o Acute deteriorating level of consciousness.
  If vascular access canno
t be established via peripheral IV in 2 attempts or less than 90 
seconds, then proceed with either IO or PVAD access. 
  Less invasive route of medication administration (PO, IN, IM) is preferred for stable 
patients prior to the attempting an IO insertion.
  Do not use if infection at site is present.
 PROCEDURE
 1. Prepare medication and 10 ml 
Normal Saline
 or IV solution flush, and tubing. Purge all 
air from lines and syringe. 
 2. Apply pressure
 cuff to IV bag if access is being made to fistula or shunt. 
 3. Wash hands thoroug
hly and/or cleanse with alcohol
-based cleanser. Sterile gloves are 
preferred for procedure if available.
 4. If betadine wipes or cleanser are not available, alcohol preps may be u
sed.
 5. Cleanse injection cap or access site with betadine wipes. If time allows, l
et set for 90 
seconds.
 6. Wipe injection cap or access site with alcohol.
 7. Due to high pressures created, never use syringes smaller than 10 ml for IV push 

medications or flushing.
 8. Never use high pressures for IV push fluids. Pressure cuffs < 150 mm.
 9. Prior to 
infusion, withdraw and discard 5 ml of blood to remove heparin lock and assure 

patency.
 10. If unable to withdraw 5 ml of blood or assure patency of line, do not continue PVAD 

acce
ss. May attempt IO access.
 11. If multiple color ports are available, the BLUE color
 port is preferred.
 NOTES
  Strict adherence to clean or aseptic technique is crucial when handling any PVAD to 

prevent infection.
  Air embolism
: The PVAD provides a direct line into the central circulation. Introduction 
of air into these devices can be hazar
dous.
 o Do not remove injection cap from catheter unless catheter is clamped
 o Do not allow IV fluids to run dry
 o Always expel air from preload/syringe prior to administration.

  Thro
mbosis
: A blood clot within the vascular device. Dislodging a clot can cause 
pulmonary embolus or vascular damage.
 o Follow medication with 5 ml 
normal saline
 or heparin solution (if wit
hin scope of 
practice) flush.
 o Do NOT inject medications or fluids if resistance 
is met. When establishing 
patency, draw back first. 
  Catheter damage
: Should damage occur to the external catheter: 
 o Clamp immediately between the skin exit site and the undamaged area to 
prevent air embolism or blood loss.
 o Use padded hemostats (or padded with 2 X 2 and tape).
  Bleeding
: If needle or catheter is dislodged from fistula or shunt, or if device is damaged 
from trauma, maintain direct pressure as for an arterial bleed
.
