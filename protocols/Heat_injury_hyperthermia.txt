  Persons at great risk of hyperthermia are infants, elderly, individuals in athletic endurance 
events, and persons taking medications that impair the bodyâ„¢s ability to re
gulate heat (e.g. 
many psychiatric medications, diuretics, alcohol).
  Heat exhaustion may progress to heat 
stroke
 without obvious external signs/symptoms.
  Heat 
stroke
 is associated with 
altered mental status

trauma and institute appropriate treatment as indicated.
  Utilize body temperature serial measurements as a tool to assess effectiveness of cooling 
measures. If temperature fails to decrease add additional therapy.
