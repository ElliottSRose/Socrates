INDICATION
  Suspected 
carbon 
monoxide 
exposure
. 
 Ambulance company medical 
directors
 must approve the use of carboxyhemoglobin 
(SpCO) monitors.
  PROCEDURE
 1. Follow manufacture™s recommendations.
  
2. Place probe on finger or; apply nasal device
. 
3. Place patient on 1
00% high
-flow 
Oxygen
.  
NOTES
 Duration of exposure and concentration of CO will determine onset and severity of symptoms. 
The symptom chart below indicates exposure and (approximate PPM 
ranges) and associated 
risks.
  Ranges
 Symptoms
 > Approx.
 35 ppm 
(0.0035%)
 Headache and dizziness within 6 
- 8 hours of constant exposure.
  100 ppm (0.01%)
  Slight headache in 2
- 3 hours.
 200 ppm (0.02%)
  Slight headache within 2 
- 3 hours. Loss of judg
men
t/confusion.
 400 ppm (0.04%)
  Frontal headache within 1 
Œ 2hours.
 800 ppm (0.08%)
  Dizziness, nausea and convulsions within 45 min. AMS within 2 hours.
 1,600 ppm (0.16%)
  Headache, 
tachycardia
s, dizziness and nausea within 20 min. Death in 
less than 2 hours.
 3,200 ppm (0.32%)
 Headache, dizziness and nausea in five to ten minutes. Death within 30 
minutes.
  6,400 ppm (0.64%)
  Headache and dizziness in one to two minutes. Convulsion
s, 
respiratory 
arrest and death in less than 20 minutes.
 12,800 ppm 
(1.28%)
  Unconsciousness after 2
Œ3 breaths. Death in less than three minutes.
   Some inhalational poisonings, such as carbon monoxide and hydrogen sulfide, may result 
in patients with nor
mal
 oxygen
 saturation readings, but cellular hypoxia due to 
displacement of the 
oxygen
 molecule from the hemoglobi
n in red blood cells.  
  In all of the above cases, maximal 
oxygen
 therapy should be delivered to the patient 
regardless of pulse oximeter or SpCO monitor readings if the patient has sig
ns 
of respiratory 
compromise.
