  Causes ﬁSLUDGEﬂ (Salivation, Lacrimation
, Urination, Diaphoresis/Diarrhea, Gastric

 may be needed to 
treat symptoms.  If the patient is initially symptomatic and no response is seen to the initial 
doses of medication, continue giving until a response is achieved. May need to acces

  Position of comfort.
  NPO
  Assess circulation, airway, breathing, an
d responsiveness.
  Oxygen
 as indicated.
  Provide 
Spinal Motion Restriction
 as indicated or position of comfort as i
ndicated.
  Appropriately splint suspected fractures/instability as indicated.
  Bandage wounds/control bleeding as indicated.
  Preserve body temperature if blister
ed area is large.
  ALS Treatment
  Advanced airway if indicated.
  Comments
  Liquid or vapor mustard penetrates the skin and mucous membranes and damages cells 
within minutes of exposure, so decontamination must be done immediately after exposure.
  Mustard a
gent can be very persistent; all surfaces with potential contamination must be 
carefully cleaned 
before considered decontaminated.
