MONITORING OF THORACOSTOMY TUBE
 CCT
 PARAMEDICS
    These procedures/interventions shall only be performed by paramedics with CCT
-P (Critical 
Care Transport
-Paramedic) training and designation.
  Patients shall be placed on cardiac and 
pulse oximetry
 monitors for duration of transport.
  Signed transfer orders from the transferring physician must
 be obtained prior to transport 
and
 must specify the maintenance of chest tube either to gravity or mechanical suction 
drainage. If mechanical
 suction drainage is utilized, the amount of
 mechanical suction must 
be specified.
  Mechanical suction rate must remain constant during transport with no changes in the rate 

being performed by the CCT
-P.  Colle
ction receptacle must be kept below the level of the chest to prevent drained fluid 
from re
-entering the pleural space. Do not allow the collection receptacle to tip over.
  If hemorrhage occurs through the chest tube, observe for signs and symptoms of 
shock
 and 
treat according to protocol.  
  Complications:
 - If the 
Thoracostomy Tube
 is partially pulled out, do NOT push the tube back into the 
chest. Secure the site.
 - If the 
Thoracostomy Tube
 is completely pulled out, place an occlusive dressing over the 
insertion site.
 - If air leaks are present, check all connections.
  If the patient becomes dyspneic, assess breath sounds and notify the base hospital 

physician (
needle thoracostomy
 may need to be performed).
   CCT-Ps may not initiate
 Thoracostomy Tubes
. 
 Avoid pulling on 
Thoracostomy Tube
 as this can cause accidental dislodgement of the tube.
  Do not restrict gravity or suction d
rainage from the chest by the use of clamps, dependent 
loops or kinks in tubing as this will interfere with the flow of drainage and may lead to 
increased pleural pressure or information of clots.
  Do not disconnect the drainage system or puncture tubing. Tape all connections securely to 

prevent violation of sterility and loss of negative pressure.
  In case of suction device failure, the end of the 
Thoracostomy Tube 
may be covered by a 
one way valve (Heimlich or similar valve device).

  If patient meets the criteria for chemical sedation and no orders are given see guidelines for 
administration of 
Midazolam
 below.
 Ven
tilator Dependent Patients
  Apply soft restraints if appropriate.
  Continuously monitor 
oxygen
 saturation, end

  Guidelines for the administra
tion of 
Midazolam
 for adults 12 years or older:
 - Midazolam
 2 Å’ 
4 mg slow IV push
 - May repeat dose every 20 
Å’ 
30 minu
tes as needed for sedation. Maximum total dose is 
10 mg.
 - Use IM only if IV access is unavailable. IM dose is 3 
Å’ 
5 mg, given deep into a large 
muscle mass. Maximum total dose is 10 mg.
 - May repeat IM dose every 60 
Å’ 
90 minutes as needed for sedation.
 Agitat
ed Patients
  Continuously monitor 
oxygen
 saturation, end
-tidal CO2, heart rate, blood pressure and LOC
  Guidelines for the administration of 
Midazolam
 for adults 12 years or older:
 - Midazolam
 2 Å’ 
4 mg slow IV push
 - May repeat with smaller IV dose of 1 
Å’ 
2 mg every 20 
Å’ 
30 minutes as needed for 
sedation
. Maximum total dose is 6 mg
 - Use IM only if IV access is unavailable. IM dose is 3 
Å’ 
5 mg, given deep into a large

Midazolam
 is 3 
Å’ 
4 times more potent than Diazepam.
  The half
-life of 
Midazolam
 is < 2 hours
. 
 Onset of action is usually 2 
Å’ 
5 minutes. Wait after each incremental dose to assess effect. A 
total dose greater than 6 mg is usually not necessary.
  Serious cardio
-respiratory complication may occur. These include respiratory depression, 
apnea, respiratory arrest and/or 
cardiac arrest
. Resuscitation equipment should be 
immediately available.
  Hypotension has been noted, particularly with concomitant narcotic administration.
  Use 25 
Å’ 3
3% less 
Midazolam
 if narcotics are co
-administered or administered prior to 
arrival.

CCT
 PARAMEDICS
   These procedures/interventions shall only be performed by paramedics with CCT

  Identify the patient and the blood by checking
 the patient ID band against the blood/blood 
product label and the blood/blood product order for patient name, blood type, unit 
identifying number and expiration date. The blood or blood product must be hung and the 

infusion initiated by a RN or MD prior t
o the CCT
-P accepting the patient for transfer.
  Patients shall be placed and maintained on cardiac and 
pulse oximetry
 monitors during 
transport.
  A non
-invasive or manual blood pressure 
monitor device that will record blood pressure 
readings and a means of measuring temperature will be utilized every fifteen (15) minutes 

to monitor for signs of adverse effects.
  Signed transfer orders from the transferring physician must be o
btained prior 
to transport 
and must
 provide for maintaining the blood/blood products infusion during transport.
  If medication administration is interrupted (infiltration, accidental disconnection, 

malfunctioning pump, etc.) the CCT
-P may restart the IV line as delineate
d in the transfer 
orders. 
  The following parameters shall apply to all patients with pre
-existing blood/blood products 
infusions:
 - Infusion will be through filtered infusion tubing compatible with the CCT
-P mechanical 
infusion device.
 - Regulation of the infu
sion rate will occur within the parameters as defined by the 

transferring physician. No other flow adjustments may be made by the CCT
-P other than 
to discontinue the infusion in the event of complications.
  If pump failure occurs and cannot be corrected, th
e CCT
-P is to discontinue the blood/blood 
products infusion and notify the transferring physician or the base hospital physician if the 

transferring physician is not available.
  In cases of suspected transfusion reactions, the blood/blood products infusion 
will be 
discontinued and notification made to both the transferring and Base Hospital Physician.
  CCT-Ps may not initiate infusions of blood or blood products.
  
 Adverse Reactions
  Hemolytic R
eactions:
 H
emolytic reactions are the most life threatening. Clini
cal 
manifestations may vary considerably
 and include
: fever, headache, chest or back pain, pain 
at the infusion site, hypotension, nausea, generalized bleeding or oozing from a surgical site 

or 
shock
. The most common cause is from ABO incompatibility due to clerical error or 
transfusion to the wrong person. Chances of survival are dose 
dependent;
 therefore it is 
important to 
STOP
 the transfusion immediately if a hemolytic reaction is su
spected. 
Administer fluid challenge of NS.
  Febrile Non
