  CARBON MONOXIDE
 (CO)  / HYDROGEN SULFIDE
  Consider CO poisoning if found unconscious, or has AMS, or non
-specific c
omplaints AND 
patient situation includes:
  Found down in enclosed space  with CO source (running motors, indoor use of 
charcoal/ gas grill/ generator or heat
er malfunction) 
  Multiple persons sharing the vicinity have similar symptoms.
  Environmental CO detec
tors are alarming.
  
Give 100% NRB or via BVM regardless of pulse oximeter reading. 
  Comments
 Patients with CO and hydrogen sulfide may have normal 
oxygen
 saturation readings, but 
cel
lular hypoxia due to displacement of the 
oxygen
 molecule from the hemoglobin in red 
blood cells.
