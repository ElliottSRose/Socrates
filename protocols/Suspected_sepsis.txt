  Comments
  Sepsis is caused 
by a whole
-body inflammatory response called, ﬁSystemic Inflammatory 
Response Syndrome ﬁcharacterized by a fever (not always present), tachycardia, tachypnea 

and hypotension. It is more common in the very young (newborns), the elderly, diabetics or 

those w
ith compromised immune systems. 
Other risk factors include: cancer/malignancies, 

renal disease, alcoholism, drug abuse, malnutrition, hypothermia or recent surgical or other 

invasive p
rocedures (e.g. long
-term venous catheters placed).  Field treatment is
 early 
recognition, fluid and notifying hospital staff about possible sepsis.
