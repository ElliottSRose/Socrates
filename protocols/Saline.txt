28 NORMAL SALINE
  ACTION:  Isotonic volume expander. Electrolyte replacement.
  Normal Saline is a sterile, nonpyrogenic solution for fluid and electrolyte replacement. 
  INDICATIONS:
  Hypotension
  Crush Syndrome
  Cardiac Arrest
  Therapeutic Hypothermia
   Suspected Sepsis
  Allergic Reaction
  AMS
  Burns
  Shock
  
CONTRAINDICATIONS:
  Severe hypertension.
  Pulmonary edema.
  POTENTIAL SIDE EFFECTS:
  Pulmonary edema.
  Febrile response.
  Hypervolemia.
  ADULT DOSE/ROUTE:
  IV/IO of Normal Saline TKO. 
  If SBP < 90 or signs of poor perfusion, fluid bolus 500 mL if lungs are clear. Reassess and repeat if 

indicated.
  Burns:
 If partial thickness or total thickness burns > 10% BSA, fluid bolus 500 mL
 if lungs are clear. 
Reassess an
d repeat if indicated. 
  Crush Syndrome:
 Bolus of 2 L followed by 500 mL/hr.
  Cardiac Arrest in Pregnancy: 
If SBP < 90 or signs of poor perfusion, fluid bolus 500 
ml
. 
Reassess and 
repeat if indicated.
  Post Cardiac Arrest or Return of Spontaneous Circulation (ROSC): 
If SBP < 90 or signs of poor 

perfusion, fluid bolus 1000 mL if lungs are clear. Reassess and repeat if indicated.  
  Therapeutic Hypothermia:
 Infuse 30 mL/Kg of Normal Saline chilled to 3Â° C (
66 Kg = 2 L using 300 
mmHg pressure infusion sleeve(s) or BP cuff. 
  Suspected Sepsis:
 For signs of hypoperfusion and HR > 100 or BP < 90, fluid bolus 1000 mL if lungs 
are clear. Reassess and repeat if indicated.
  
PEDIATRIC DOSE/ROUTE:
  IV/IO of Normal Salin
e TKO. 
  Pediatric
 hypovolemic shock
: IV/IO bolus of 20 mL/Kg. Repeat up to 60 mL/Kg if indicated.
  Neonatal
 hypovolemic shock
: 10 mL/Kg. Repeat up to 30 mL/Kg.
  AMS of Unknown Cause: 
IV/IO bolus of 10 mL/Kg.
  NOTES:
  Use cautiously in patients with congestive
 heart failure, severe renal insufficiency, and in clinical 
states in which there exists edema with sodium retention (e.g., patients with diminished renal 

function.)
  Discontinue bolus if pulmonary edema develops.
