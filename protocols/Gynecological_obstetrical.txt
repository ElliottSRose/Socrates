 DELIVERY
 BLS
 Treatment
 IF BABY
 IS NOT
 CROWNING
: Assist
 mother
 into
 posi
tion of comfort
 and
 transport.
 IF BABY
 IS CROWNING:
  For
 mother:
 If hypoxic,
 Oxygen
 via
 nasal
 cannula
 at 2-6 
L/min
 or via
 non
-rebreather
 mask
 at 10-15 L/min
 as tolerated.
  Assist
 mother
 i
nto 
position
 of comfort.
   Prepare
 area
 for
 delivery
 to prevent
 baby
 from
 hitting
 hard
 surface.
 Have
 blanket/chux
 ready
 to catch
 baby.
  Support
 the
 baby™s
 head.
 Apply
 gentle
 pressure
 to perineum
 to prevent
 tearing.
 Do NOT
 pull
 on baby™s
 head.
 If necessary,
 a
sk mother
 to push
 again
 to deliver
 the
 rest
 of the baby.
  Dry
 and
 cover
 newborn
 for
 warmth
 (especially
 the head).
 If possible,
 place
 skin
 to skin
 with
 the mother
 on abdomen
 or to breast
 for
 shared
 body
 heat.
 Wrap
 mother
 and
 baby
 together.
  If baby
 delivers
 a
nd cord
 is tight,
 unwind
 cord
 from
 neck
 or shoulder.
  Check
 APGAR
 score
 at 1 
and
 5 
minutes
 post
-delivery
 (see
 below).
  Assess
 VS of mother
 and
 baby
 post
-delivery
 and
 after
 placenta
 delivers.
 If signs
 of shock
, see
 below
 under
 ALS 
Treatment.
  Allow
 the
 cord
 to pulse
 for
 at least
 one
 minute
 OR until
 pulsing
 stops
 OR until
 transfer
 to receiving
 hospital.
 To cut
 the
 cord,
 clamp
 cord
 with
 2 
clamps
 and
 cut
 cord
 between
 clamps.
 If the cord
 interf
eres
 with
 newborn
 resuscitation,
 cut
 the
 cord
 immediately.
  Cover
 visible
 portion
 of cord
 with
 sterile
 gauze
 moistened
 with
 Normal
 Saline
 (to
 prevent
 spasm
 and
 premature
 delivery).
 Warm
 Normal
 Sali
ne is preferred.
  Allow
 spontaneous
 birth
 of placenta
 and
 save
 all available
 parts
 for
 inspection
 at hospital.
 Do not
 delay
 transport
 for
 delivery
 of placenta.
 Allow
 parents
 to transport
 bagged
 placenta
 if desired.
  If bleeding
 persists
 after
 delivery
 of placenta,
 rub
 abdomen
 below
 navel
 with
 flat
 hand
 x 
15 seconds
 PRN
 (uterine
 massage).
 As uterus
 contracts,
 it should
 feel
 like
 a 
firm
 grapefruit
 and
 bleeding
 should
 slow.
 ALS
 Treatment
 See
 below
 for
 specific
 ALS
 treatment
 of delivery
 complications.
 Comment
s  Suction
 only
 if airway
 is obstructed.
 Routine
 suctioning
 only
 delays
 the onset
 of spontaneous
 breathing
 and
 cause
 laryngeal
 spasm
 and
 vagal
 bradycardia.
  
 Delayed
 cord
 clam
ping
 allows
 oxygenated
 blood
 to continue
 to flow
 to infant.
