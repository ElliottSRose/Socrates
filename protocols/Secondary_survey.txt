  The secondary survey is the systematic assessment and complaint
-focused relevant physical 
examination of the patient.
   The Primary Survey and initial treatment and stabilization of life
-threatening airway, 
breathing and circulation difficulties.
  Need for 
Spinal Motion Restriction
. 
 A rapid trauma assessment (if indicated by related trauma protocol).
  Transport of the potentially unstable or critical patient.
  Investigation of the chief com
plaint and associated complaints, signs or symptoms.
  An initial set of vital signs:
 o Pulse.
 o Blood pressure.
 o Respiration.
 o Lung sounds.
 o Pupils.
 o Cardiac rhythm (if indicated by related protocol).
 o Pulse oximetry
. 
o Blood 
Glucose
 (if indicated by related protocol).
 o Determine Glascow Coma Scale (GCS) Score:
  Eye Opening
 Verbal Response
 Motor Response
 4 = Spontaneous
 5 = Orien
ted
 6 = Obeys Commands
 3 = To verbal stimuli
 4 = Confused
 5 = Purposeful / Localizes pain
 2 = To painful stimuli
 3 = Inappropriate words
 4 = Withdraws to pain
 1 = No Response
 2 = Incomprehensible words
 3 = Flexion to pain
  1 = No Response
 2 = Extension

   1 = No Response
  USING THE GCS TO ASSESS INFANTS AND YOUNG CHILDREN:
 Eye Opening
 Verbal Response
 Motor Response
 4 = Spontaneous
 5 = Smiles, oriented to sounds, follows objects, 
interacts
 6 = Obeys Commands
 3 = To verbal stimuli
 4 = Cries but
 is consolable; inappropriate 
interactions
 5 = Purposeful/Localizes pain
 2 = To painful stimuli
 3 = Inconsistently consolable, moaning
 4 = Withdrawal from pain
 1 = No response
 2 = Inconsolable, agitated
 3 = Flexion to pain
  1 = No vocal response
 2 = Ext
ension to pain
   1 = No motor response
  HISTORY
  Obtain Patient History from available sources.
  Allergies.
  Medications. Past medical history relevant to chief complaint

  scale.)
  O= Onset (Sudden or gradual)
  P= Provoke (What were you doing when the pain started? Does anything 
make it better or worse?) 
  Q= Quality (What does the pain feel like?) 
  R= Region/Radiate (Where is the pain? Does it
 go anywhere else?) 
  S= Severity (On a scale of 1
-10, 10 being the worst pain you have ever had, 
how would you rate that pain now? How would you rate that pain at its 

worst or during exertion/movement?) 
  T= Time (When or what time did this start?)
 o PASTE (U
sed for Shortness of Breath Assessment)
  P= Progression (Sudden or gradual?)
  A= Assoc. Chest Pain (If yes, which came first?) 
  S= Sputum (Are you coughing anything up? If yes, what color is it?) 
  T= Time, Temp, Talkability (When or what time did this start?
 Have you had 
or do you have a fever? How many word sentences can the patient speak in?) 
  E= Exercise tolerance (What is the patient™s tolerance for exertion? Can they 

get up and walk without getting SOB? What is their baseline tolerance level?)
  Mechanism 
of injury (as indicated by relevant protocol).
 For focused history findings relevant to specific patient complaints, see protocols 

related to each chief complaint.
 EXPOSE, EXAMINE & EVALUATE:
  Minimize on scene time for trauma patients
  All physical assessme
nts for trauma should determine the presence or absence of 
DCAP-
BTLS
:  o Deformity
 o Contusion/Crepitus
 o Abrasion
 o Puncture
 o Bruising/Bleeding
 o Tenderness
 o Laceration
 o Swelling
  In situations with suspected life threatening trauma mechanism, a rapid trauma assessment
 should be performed:
 o Expose head, trunk, and extremities.
 o Rapid Trauma Assessment looking for and treating life threatening injuries.
 o See relevant protocols for Head, Neck, Facial, Chest, Abdominal, Pelvis, and Extremity.
  Treat any newly discovered life
-t
hreatening wounds.
