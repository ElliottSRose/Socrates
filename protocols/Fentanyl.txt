15  FENTANYL CITRATE (Sublimaze)
  
 ACTION:  Opioid Analgesic
 Ł Centrally acting opiate analgesic effective for acute 
pain.
 Ł For cardiac patients: fentanyl reduces the pain of ischemia and reduces anxiety, reducing 

oxygen demands on the heart, improving perfusion.
  
INDICATIONS:
 Ł 
Chest pain of suspected ischemic origin.
 Ł 
Management of acute pain according to ALS 
Treatment Protocols.
  
CONTRAINDICATIONS:
 Ł 
Hypersensitivity or prior allergic reaction
 Ł 
Respiratory Insufficiency
  
Ł 
Asthma or exacerbated COPD
 Ł 
Head injury
 Ł 
Hypotension
 Ł 
Decreased LOC
  POTENTIAL SIDE EFFECTS:
  Respiratory depression
  Hypotension
  Decreased LOC
  Nausea and vomiting
  Bradycardia
  Muscle rigidity (rare)
  ADULT DOSE/ROUTE:
  50 mcg IV/IO slow IV push (over 1 minute). May repeat every 5 minutes if SBP > 90 mm Hg. 

The maximum dose is 200 mcg without base contact.
   If no 
IV/IO, 100 mcg IN or IM (IN preferred). May repeat every 10 minutes if SBP > 90 mm Hg. 
The maximum dose is 200 mcg without base contact.
  PEDIATRIC DOSE/ROUTE:
  If IV/IO, 1 mcg/kg/dose IV/IO up to 50mcg slow IV push (over 1 minute).  Subsequent dose 

up to 
25 mcg may be repeated every 10 minutes up to the maximum dose of 100 mcg 

without Base Hospital contact.
   If 
no IV/IO, 2 mcg/kg/dose IN or IM (IN preferred) up to 50 mcg. Subsequent dose up to 25 
mcg may be repeated every 10 minutes up to the maximum dose 
of 100 mcg without Base 

Hospital contact.
  
NOTES:
 Ł Rapid infusions of Fentanyl have been associated with chest wall rigidity and respiratory 
depression, particularly in pediatrics. Administer doses over 1
-2 min to prevent 
occurrence.

16 Ł Fentanyl is 100x stronger than Morphine and is dosed in micro
grams. It is faster acting 
than 
Morphine (peak effect 5
-10 minutes) and has a shorter duration of effect 
(approximately 30 minutes). 100 mcg of Fentanyl is approximately equivalent to 10 mg 
of Morphine.
 Ł Fentanyl can ca
use depressed respiratory status. Be prepared to assist ventilations in 
patients receiving Fentanyl.
 Ł Respiratory depression from Fentanyl can be reversed with Naloxone.
 Ł Fentanyl™s effects can be potentiated by Midazolam. Contact the Base Hospital Physician
 before administering both Fentanyl and Midazolam.
 Ł Contact the Base Hospital Physician if higher doses of Fentanyl are required for 
adequate pain control.
