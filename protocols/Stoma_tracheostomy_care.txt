STOMA AND TRACHEOSTOMY CARE
  
CCT
 PARAMEDICS
   These procedures/interventions shall only be performed by paramedics with CCT
-P (Critical 
Care Transport
-Paramedic) training and designation.
  
 Use of demand valve is contraindicated in both suctioning and stoma intubation.
  CCT-Ps may not initiate a surgical airway.
  Suctioning of a tracheostomy tube should take no longer than ten (10) seconds for the adult 
patient.
  Allow no longer than 30 (thirty) seconds for stoma intubation.
  Temporary or permanent placemen
t of a tracheostomy tube is often necessary to maintain 
an open airway.
  Patients with tracheostomy tubes or stomas should not be intubated orally
. 
 Administration of inhaled medications will need to be given via the stomas or tracheostomy 
tubes.
  Never attem
pt to reinsert a dislodged tracheostomy tube. Trying to do so may cause a false 
channel in the subcutaneous tissue anterior to the trachea. Compression of the trachea may 
result.
  Procedure: 
 1. Adjust suction to 120 
Œ 
150 mmHg
. 
2. Apply sterile gloves
. 
3. Flush su
ction catheter with saline to lubricate tip and establish patency of suction 
catheter.
 4. Remove the T
-tube if a tracheostomy patient is on humidified 
oxygen
. 
5. Ventilate the patient with 10
0% 
oxygen
 several times
. 
6. Insert the suction catheter into the stoma or tracheostomy opening with the suction off 

(the thumb hole open). The short length of the tracheostomy tube facilitates suctioning. 

The catheter may be directed through the right or left bronchus by having the patient 

turn his/her head to the opposite side.
 7. Apply suction by occluding the thumb hole while slowly withdrawing the catheter in a 

twisting motion. 
 8. If mucous 
plugs or thick secretions are present, the instillation of 3 
Œ 
5 ml of sterile 
saline may be helpful.
 9. Ventilate with 100% 
oxygen
. 
10. Check breath sounds
. 
11. Suctioning can stimulate a cough reflex. Allow the patient to cough. Be prepared to 

suction or catch secretions from the tracheal opening. Recheck breath sounds.
  Stoma Intubation
 Equipment:
 1. Appropriate sized cuffed and uncuffed ET tubes
 2. Bag valve mask
 3. Appropriate sized suction catheters

4. Oxygen
 supply
 5. Suction equipment with adjustable suction capacity
  Procedure: 
 1. Select the largest endotracheal tube that will fit through the stoma without force. Check 
the cuff, unless an uncuffed tube is being used
. 
2. Ventilate with 100% 
oxygen
 using a bag valve mask device with the face mask fitted 
over the stoma. (see 
PRECAUTIONS and COMMENTS
) 
3. Wear sterile gloves. Do 
not use stylet. It is not necessary to lubricate the tube
 4. Suction if necessary
. 
5. Pass the endotracheal tube ½ the length of the tube and inflate the cuff. The pharynx 

has been bypassed, so the tube will protrude from the neck several inches.
 6. Hold the tube in place, watch for chest rise with ventilation.
 7. Secure the tube and ventilate.
 8. Auscultate the lung fields. Check the neck for subcutaneous emphysema, indicating false 

passage. Confirm tube placement with standard methods per airway protocols.
