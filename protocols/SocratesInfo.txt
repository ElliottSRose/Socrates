Socrates: a personal research assistant that will retrieve and read information back to you. Socrates listens for 4 specific keywords, stated at the start of a command. These keywords are SEARCH, OPEN, FIND, and STOP. After the keyword, the query is stated by the user, and then Socrates attempts to use the query and the search term to retrieve the appropriate information. SEARCH will provide a Wikipedia answer. OPEN will open a local file and read it back to you. And FIND will work after the speaker has begun reading back what has been returned to you after your initial query. The FIND command searches the returned text and goes to the first sentence that contains the FIND search term, interrupts the speaker, and has the speaker read the text starting at the FIND result. If the FIND search term is not found, the speaker continues reading the originally returned query result. 
An example of Socrates in action would start with opening the app and then pressing the Start Socrates button. Socrates then greets you with a “Yes?” and you might start a query like: “Search Concurrency.” Socrates then would search Wikipedia and start reading you the page on concurrency. You could then say something like, “Find threading” and the speaker would stop speaking, find the first sentence that “threading” appears in, and begin reading the text from that sentence. This all happens quickly with only a second or two of interruption. Once you have heard the information you were looking for, the speaker may still be reading you more text. So, you might say, “STOP” and the speaker would then acknowledge your command, saying “OK, I’ll stop talking now” and stop speaking (You can also stop Socrates at any time by pressing the STOP button on the UI). At this point, the program is in a ready state, but not listening. To start Socrates again, you simply need to press the start button on the UI.
