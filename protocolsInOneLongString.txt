 PREHOSPITAL CARE VISION AND ETHICS STATEMENT
 2015 Our EMS community consists of a team of health care professionals including EMT
-1™s, Paramedics, 
Nurses, Physicians, Researchers, Dispatchers and system Educators and Admini
strators. This statement 
defines our goals and ethical responsibilities and is beneficial in guiding our practice.
 We believe that–
  We exist to provide the best possible emergency care to the residents and visitors of the City 
and County of San Francisco a
t all times and in all places.
  Competent medical care must be provided with compassion and regard for human dignity to all 
persons, regardless of ethnicity, race, creed, gender, economic status, sexual orientation, 
gender identity, age or response to our c
are.
  Patients who are competent have the right to determine what shall be done with their body and 

to receive or refuse medical service and to know the consequences of their decision.
  We are accountable for providing medical care to the best of our ability
 and for accurately 
documenting our care.
  Patients and colleagues must be dealt with in an honest and truthful manner in all matters 
pertaining to our prehospital care.
  The highest standard of professional conduct must be maintained with providing medical 
care, 
including respect, confidentiality and maintenance of personal competence and teaching other 
members of the prehospital community.
  We are responsible for upholding the standards of the profession and for participating in 
activities that contribute to
 its growth and improve our community.
  We must obey and respect the law and not participate in any professionally unethical activities. 

We refuse to let personal considerations such as economic gain or convenience influence our 
provision of patient care, and we refrain from activities which may impair our professional 

judgment and our ability to act competently.
  Our EMS system, organization, supervisors, peers and subordinates deserve our utmost loyalty.
  Where conflicts of interest arise, our professional j
udgments should always be guided by our 
ultimate obligation which is to our patients and the public that we serve.
  We are committed to accomplishing our job; and that commitment stems from the desire to be 

the best we can possibly be and the affirmation of
 all the preceding elements of this code.Section 1: Assessment1.01 PATIENT ASSESSMENT

 The purpose of the primary survey is to identify and immediately correct life
-threatening 
problems.
 A primary survey shall be performed on all patients (as defined in Policy 4040) upon 
contact, following determination of scene safety. Should a provider be 
unable to perform a 
Primary Survey, the circumstances shall be documented in a Patient Care Report.
  SCENE SIZE
-UP / GLOBAL ASSESSMENT:
  Recognize hazards, ensure safety of scene and secure a safe area for treatment.
  Apply appropriate universal body/substance isolation precautions.
  Identify number of patients and whether additional resources are needed
  Observe position of patient and determine chief complaint or mechanism of injury.
  Plan strategy to protect evidence at potential crime scene.

  AIRWAY:
  Ensure patent
 airway.
  Protect spine from unnecessary movement in patients at risk for spinal injury.
  Look and 
listen for evidence of upper airway problems and potential obstructions:
  Utilize any appropriate adjuncts as indicated to maintain airway.
  BREATHING:
  Assess for breathing.
  Intervention for inadequate ventilation and/or oxygenation using approved adjuncts 
as indicated.
  CIRCULATION:
 Check for pulse. If no pulse, begin CPR and/or defibrillate while following appropriate 
cardiac

1. Attempt
 to locate
 a 
POLST
 form.
 Many

 in a 
manner
 consis
tent
 with
 ALS 
and
 BLS
 treatment
 protocols
 for
 the patient™s
 condition
 with
 the
 following
 exceptions:
   
Ł Do NOT
 perform
 chest
 compressions
 since
 it will
 dislodge
 the
 LVAD
 and
 cause
 internal
 bleeding.
 Ł Arrhythmias
: Do 
not
 disconnect
 power
 source,
 defibrillate
 per
 ACLS
 protocol.
 Ł DO follow
 the
 directions
 of the patient™s
 caregiver
 when
 moving
 and
 transporting
 the patient.
   
 3. The
 HeartMate
 (HM)

 replaces
 the
 pumping
 action
 of the

 mechanism,
 where
 there
 is no fillin

Ł As a 
result,
 patients
 commonly
 have
 NO
 PALPABLE 
PULSE,
 NO

 Ł An LVAD
 patient™s
 ECG
 heart
 rate
 will
 differ
 from
 the pulse
 rate
 since
 the LVAD
 is not
 synchronized
 with
 the
 native
 heart
 rate.
    4. Assess
 the
 patient™s
 airway
 and
 intervene
 per
 protocol.
 If you
 are unable
 to obtain
 pulse
 oximetry
 readings,
 you
 should
 assume
 the patient
 is hypoxic
 and
 place
 the
 patient
 on supplemental
 oxy
gen
.  
 5. If the
 patient
 has
 an altered
 level
 of consciousness,
 immediately
 check
 for
 end
-tidal
 CO2
 using
 capnography.
  
 6. Auscultate
 heart
 sounds
 to determine
 if the
 device
 is functioning.
 You
 should
 expect
 to hear
 a 
continuous
 ﬁwhirlingﬂ
 sound
 for
 most
 devic
es.
  
 7. Assess
 the
 device
 for
 any
 alarms / 
malfunctions.
 Check
 with
 patient
 or caregivers
 for
 device
 reference
 materials
 or contact
 the
 VAD
 Center.
  8. Start
 at least
 1 
large
 bore
 IV,
 and
 give
 a 
1L Normal
 Saline
 fluid
 bolus
 if you
 obtain
 a 
low
 blood
 pressure
 (systolic
 < 
100)
 or are
 unable
 to obtain
 a 
blood
 pressure
 or the
 patient
 has
 an altered
 level
 on consciousness.
  
 9. Call the LVAD
 Center
 (open
 24/7)
 per
 patient
 or patient™s
 caretaker™s
 contact
 to get
 advice
 on caring
 for
 the patient.
  You are
 authorized
 to take
 orders
 from
 professionals
 at the

 as long
 as they
 are within
 your

  Contact
 the
 Base
 Hospital
 with
 questions
 or if directed
 by patient™s

 or LVAD 
Center
 personnel
 to do something
 outside
 of 
your
 protocol.
    10. Always
 transport
 the
 patient
 to the

  Comments
 *CINCINNATI PREHOSPITAL STROKE SCALE (C
PSS):
  Apply CPSS if you suspect that the sudden 
neurological impairment is due to stroke. If patient scores ﬁabnormalﬂ in any of the following 3 
tests, there is a 72% likelihood of stroke:
 1. Facial Droop 
- 
Have patient show teeth or smile:
 Normal:
 both side
s 
of face move equally.
 Abnormal:
 one side of face does not move as well as the other side.
  2. Pronator Drift 
- 
Patient closes eyes and holds both arms straight out for 10 seconds:
 Normal:
 both arms move the same or both arms do not move at all. 
 Abnormal:
 on
e arm does not move
, 
or one arm drifts down compared with the other.
  3. Abnormal Speech 
- 
Have the patient repeat a statement such as, ﬁYou can™t teach an old 
dog new tricksﬂ:
 Normal:
 patient uses correct words with no slurring.
 Abnormal:
 patient slurs word
s, uses the wrong words, or is unable to speak.2.15 SUSPECTED SEPSIS

> 38° C or 
< 36° C
  Heart Rate 
> 90  Respiratory Rate
 >
 20  If answer to BOTH #1 and #2 is YES, continue with sepsis protocol. Otherwise go to other 

applicable protocol. 
  Comments
  Sepsis is caused 
by a whole
-body inflammatory response called, ﬁSystemic Inflammatory 
Response Syndrome ﬁcharacterized by a fever (not always present), tachycardia, tachypnea 

and hypotension. It is more common in the very young (newborns), the elderly, diabetics or 

those w
ith compromised immune systems. 
Other risk factors include: cancer/malignancies, 

renal disease, alcoholism, drug abuse, malnutrition, hypothermia or recent surgical or other 

invasive p
rocedures (e.g. long
-term venous catheters placed).  Field treatment is
 early 
recognition, fluid and notifying hospital staff about possible sepsis.

INDICATION
 Patients who present following decelerating or blunt force injury suspicious for head or neck 
trauma with any of the following should have Spinal Motion Restriction:
  Midline back or neck pain.
  Numbness, weakness or paresthesias of the extremitie
s.  Blunt and or penetrating injury to the head or neck
. Penetrating trauma does not 
require SMR unless spinal injury is suspected.
  Altered mental status
 of unknown etiology with traumatic injury suspected.
  
Spinal Motion Restriction is NOT indicated if the patient meets ALL the following criteria
: 
 Age <65.
  No decrease or change in baseline mental or neurological status.
  No suspected or witnessed axial load injury to head.
  No numbness, we
akness or paresthesias of the extremities.
  No significant distracting injuries.
  Reliable translation for any language barrier.
  No vertebral column injury noted on palpation.
  Patient able to perform motor/sensory exam without deficits:
 o Wrist or finger flexi
on (both hands), plantarflexion (both feet), dorsiflexion (both 

feet). 
 o Check gross sensation in all extremities.
 o Check for parasthesias.
  
EMTs and Paramedics shall apply or direct application of SMR whenever extent of injury is in 
question or patient hist
ory is unreliable.
  PROCEDURE
 1. Limit flexion, extension, rotation and distraction of spine.
 2. Provide manual stabilization restricting gross motion. 
 3. Reduce gross movement of patient.
 4. Prevent duplicating the damaging mechanism to spine.
 5. Regularly assess senso
ry and motor function.
 6. Obtain assistance (minimum 2
-person procedure) to apply rigid cervical collar.  Alert and 
co-operative patients may be allowed to self
-limit motion, if appropriate, without 
cervical collar.
  
NOTES
  Methods used to achieve Spinal Motion Restriction that are allowable include (less 
restrictive to more restrictive)
: 
o Lateral, semi
-fowler™s or fowler™s position with cervical collar onl
y. o Soft collars

 INDICATION
  Suspected or Obvious extremity fracture.
  Appropriate splinting can reduce or minimize dislocation, motion, hemorrhage, swelling, 
and pain. 
  PROCEDURE 
 1. Remove or cut away clothing. 
 2. Dress and bandage significant wounds using a sterile dressing. 
 3. Check CMS distal to injury before and after splinting. 
 4. Immobilize joints above and below injured bones. 
 5. For joint injuries, leave in place and immobilize the bone above and below the joint 
 6. If extremity is pulseless
 it may be necessary on a mid
-shaft (center 1/3) fracture to 
realign angulated injuries. 
 7. Pad splints well. 
 8. Elevate extremity after splinting, if possible. 
 9. Monitor CMS after splinting. 
  GUIDELINES FOR SPECIFIC INJURIES 
 Realignment of Long Bone Fractures 
  If extremity is pulseless
 attempt t
o realign (open or closed) long bones that are 
angulated in the middle 1/3 then splint. If resistance to movement is encountered or 

pain is too severe, discontinue realignment efforts and immobilize in place. 
  Long-
bone fractures which occur in the proxima
l or distal 1/3, that may or may not 
involve a joint, may be realigned if compromise of distal circulation or nerve function is 
detected and transport is prolonged. 
  Realignment may sometimes be necessary to facilitate packaging for transport. 
  Check and d
ocument CMS before and after splinting and/or realignment. 
  Dislocations/Sprains 
  Splint dislocations or other joint injuries in the position found. 
  Exception: Loss of a distal pulse and neurological function and definitive care is delayed. 
 o In that case
, attempt to straighten into anatomical position until the pulse 
returns, excessive pain is felt, or resistance is encountered. 
 o Support with blanket, pillow, or well
-padded splint. 
 o Elevate the limb. 
 o Pack the injured area in ice or use an ice pack.

 11.01 SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES:
 AUSTERE CARE
  AUSTERE MEDICAL CARE CONCEPT
  Austere Medical Care (ﬁAustere Careﬂ) 
is a modified standard of care provided during disaster 
situations when medical resources, supplies and / or medical personnel are extremely lim
ited 
or unavailable. Situations in which this may occur include an earthquake with major 

infrastructure damage or biological events with depletion of health care resources, or 

disruptions to the normal supply chains. The goal of a modified standard of care
 is to provide a 
basic (austere) level of medical care that is less time and resource intensive. By modifying the 

standard of care to a more basic (austere) level, fewer medical resources are provided to an 

individual person, but, instead are distributed t
o a greater number of individuals in a given 
population.   The intent of austere medical care standards is to attempt to do the most good for 

the greatest number of people during a disaster situation. 
  
Austere Care is only rendered in the setting of disas
ter or isolation and requires activation as 
described in this protocol.  Austere Care is never considered advantageous over normal 

emergency medical care and cannot be used in settings where normal or comprehensive 

emergency care is available.
  ACTIVATION/
DEACTIVATION OF AUSTERE CARE
  Austere care is only authorized by the County Health Officer or his or her designee
.  Communication of the decision to use Austere Care will come through the Incident Command 

System chain of authority.  Medical units will rend
er care as described in the following 
protocols.  If warranted, standard emergency medical care protocols can be utilized at the 

discretion of the Medical Group Supervisor depending on local conditions.  Austere Care is 

designed to be a ﬁfloorﬂ level of medical care, which may be superseded or augmented as 

conditions permit. 
 
 
AUSTERE CARE GUIDELINES
 
The following table identifies changes to the treatment of patient conditions covered in the 

Standard Treatment Protocols under Austere Care:

  Patients shall be placed on cardiac and 
pulse oximetry
 monitors for duration of transport.
  Signed transfer orders from the transferring physician must
 be obtained prior to transport 
and
 must specify the maintenance of chest tube either to gravity or mechanical suction 
drainage. If mechanical
 suction drainage is utilized, the amount of
 mechanical suction must 
be specified.
  Mechanical suction rate must remain constant during transport with no changes in the rate 

being performed by the CCT
-P.  Colle
ction receptacle must be kept below the level of the chest to prevent drained fluid 
from re
-entering the pleural space. Do not allow the collection receptacle to tip over.
  If hemorrhage occurs through the chest tube, observe for signs and symptoms of 
shock
 and 
treat according to protocol.  
  Complications:
 - If the 
Thoracostomy Tube
 is partially pulled out, do NOT push the tube back into the 
chest. Secure the site.
 - If the 
Thoracostomy Tube
 is completely pulled out, place an occlusive dressing over the

 - If air leaks are present, check all connections.
  If the patient becomes dyspneic, assess breath sounds and notify the base hospital 

physician (
needle thoracostomy
 may need to be performed).
   CCT-Ps may not initiate
 Thoracostomy Tubes
. 
 Avoid pulling on 
Thoracostomy Tube
 as this can cause accidental dislodgement of the tube.
  Do not restrict gravity or suction d
rainage from the chest by the use of clamps, dependent 
loops or kinks in tubing as this will interfere with the flow of drainage and may lead to 
increased pleural pressure or information of clots.
  Do not disconnect the drainage system or puncture tubing. Tape all connections securely to 

prevent violation of sterility and loss of negative pressure.
  In case of suction device failure, the end of the 
Thoracostomy Tube 
may be covered by a 
one way valve (Heimlich or similar valve device).SAN

STOMA AND TRACHEOSTOMY CARE
  
CCT
 PARAMEDICS
   These procedures/interventions shall only be performed by paramedics with CCT
-P (Critical 
Care Transport
-Paramedic) training and designation.
  
 Use of demand valve is contraindicated in both suctioning and stoma intubation.
  CCT-Ps may not initiate a surgical airway.
  Suctioning of a tracheostomy tube should take no longer than ten (10) seconds for the adult 
patient.
  Allow no longer than 30 (thirty) seconds for stoma intubation.
  Temporary or permanent placemen
t of a tracheostomy tube is often necessary to maintain 
an open airway.
  Patients with tracheostomy tubes or stomas should not be intubated orally
. 
 Administration of inhaled medications will need to be given via the stomas or tracheostomy 
tubes.
  Never attem
pt to reinsert a dislodged tracheostomy tube. Trying to do so may cause a false 
channel in the subcutaneous tissue anterior to the trachea. Compression of the trachea may 
result.
  Procedure: 
 1. Adjust suction to 120 
Œ 
150 mmHg
. 
2. Apply sterile gloves
. 
3. Flush su
ction catheter with saline to lubricate tip and establish patency of suction 
catheter.
 4. Remove the T
-tube if a tracheostomy patient is on humidified 
oxygen
. 
5. Ventilate the patient with 10
0% 
oxygen
 several times
. 
6. Insert the suction catheter into the stoma or tracheostomy opening with the suction off 

(the thumb hole open). The short length of the tracheostomy tube facilitates suctioning. 

The catheter may be directed through the right or left bronchus by having the patient 

turn his/her head to the opposite side.
 7. Apply suction by occluding the thumb hole while slowly withdrawing the catheter in a 

twisting motion. 
 8. If mucous 
plugs or thick secretions are present, the instillation of 3 
Œ 
5 ml of sterile 
saline may be helpful.
 9. Ventilate with 100% 
oxygen
. 
10. Check breath sounds
. 
11. Suctioning can stimulate a cough reflex. Allow the patient to cough. Be prepared to 

suction or catch secretions from the tracheal opening. Recheck breath sounds.
  Stoma Intubation
 Equipment:

 5. Suction equipment with adjustable suction capacity
  Procedure: 
 1. Select the largest endotracheal tube that will fit through the stoma without force. Check 
the cuff, unless an uncuffed tube is being used
. 
2. Ventilate with 100% 
oxygen
 using a bag valve mask device with the face mask fitted 
over the stoma. (see 
PRECAUTIONS and COMMENTS
) 
3. Wear sterile gloves. Do 
not use stylet. It is not necessary to lubricate the tube
 4. Suction if necessary
. 
5. Pass the endotracheal tube ½ the length of the tube and inflate the cuff. The pharynx 

has been bypassed, so the tube will protrude from the neck several inches.
 6. Hold the tube in place, watch for chest rise with ventilation.
 7. Secure the tube and ventilate.
 8. Auscultate the lung fields. Check the neck for subcutaneous emphysema, indicating false 

passage. Confirm tube placement with standard methods per airway protocols.SAN FRANCISCO EMS AGENCY

Bronchospasm and respiratory secretions are the best acute symptoms to monitor for evaluating the response to Atropine/2-PAM:
CHLORIDE  
(2-PAM)  
         Decreased bronchospasm and respiratory secretions = getting better. 
Concentration 600 mg/2 ml 
         No change or increased bronchospasm and respiratory secretions = needs more 2-PAM
   Dose 20 mg/kg IM /IV  
These dosages are not  
available outside of the  
autoinjectors, but are as
